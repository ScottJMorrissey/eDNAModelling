#The code contained within this github is used to undertake particle releases emulating eDNA and to process associated data.

#ParticleRelease - this is the code for releasing particles from set locations with the hydrodynamic model.
#Visualisation-MapPlots - this is the code for visualising released particles on maps.
#ParticleDistance - this is the code for determining the distances at which particles travelled from the initial release point for each timestep.
#BoundaryBoxSummer/Winter - this is the code for determining the relative abudance of particles within a defined area.
#Log-normalised Relative eDNA particle concentration map plots - this is the code for determining the detectability of eDNA from release locations.

#The code needed to create the hydrodynamic model for this can be found within the SLIM gitub (https://git.immc.ucl.ac.be/slim/slim/-/wikis/home)

#For permission to use this code - please contact Scott Morrissey (scott.morrissey@my.jcu.edu.au)
